I am a M.S. & Ph.D. student in the [Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/), where I am advised by [Prof. Kijung Shin](https://kijungs.github.io/) at [Data Mining Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/kaistdata). I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/skku/index.do). I will join [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) as an applied scientist intern this September. My research interests include data mining, graph mining, social network analysis, and machine learning.
